## About

A recent trend in people disapproving of '`whiteboard algorithm`'-style interviews has 
  got _other_ people saying things like '`algorithms are irrelevant.`' I'm...50/50 on it.
  Personally, I don't spend hours a day trying to solve the latest HackerRank challenge
  or whatever, but I think there's a fair bit of value in learning the standard data
  structures and design patterns. They're used in the real world on a daily
  basis; many of the modern tools that seem complex at first are rooted in these patterns
  and structures, and a basic understanding of such topics will demystify those tools
  quickly.
